# Optimizing Nested Virtualization Performance Using Direct Virtual Hardware
This repository is for Artifacts Evaluation for ASPLOS 2020. It has all the source code and instructions to run the key experiments presented in Figures 7 and 9.

## Prerequisites
* Two physical machines connected by <em>private</em> network for stable and precise measurements.
  * Cloudlab.us provides machines and preconfigured profiles. Machines will be available upon request for artifact evaluation. See [Instructions for Cloudlab](#instructions-for-cloudlab).

## Overview
The experiments measure various application performance on one machine, the server machine (i.e. bare-metal machine and virtual machines), while the other machine, which is the client machine, sends workloads to the server machine.

We compare application performance on bare-metal to that on virtual machines at different virtualization levels (from 1 to 3) with different configurations (baseline, passthrough, DVH-VP, and DVH).

On both the server and client machines, you need to do the [basic preparation](#basic-preparation) for running various scripts and compiling source code.

On the server, you need to install [a proper kernel version](#software-configurations), update [kernel parameters](#kernel-parameter-setup), and use [a proper QEMU version](#software-configurations) for each experiment configurations in all virtualization levels. Once it's ready, you can start [running a virtual machine](#running-a-virtual-machine).

On the client, you need to install [baseline kernel](#client-machine) without further updating kernel parameters and QEMU. Once the server is running a virtual machine (or none for bare-metal measurements), [run application benchmarks and collect results](#running-application-benchmarks-and-collect-results). The script to run the application benchmarks will automatically install the benchmarks on both the server (including virtual machines) and the client if they are not yet installed.

## Basic preparation
Clone this repository on both machines as a **root** user in **the home directory**. Note that all the commands other than this `git clone` command need to be executed in the directory this repo is cloned.
```
# git clone https://github.com/columbia/dvh-asplos-ae.git
# cd dvh-asplos-ae
```

Run this command to copy helper scripts to a local directory in $PATH, which is set to /usr/local/bin in the script.
```
# cd scripts
# ./install_scripts.sh
```

Run this command to install packages used to compile software and run VMs. See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for any problems.
```
# ./install_packages.sh
```

Lastly, copy the client machine ssh public key to `scripts/client_ssh_public` file **on the server machine**. This enables the client machine to access any level of virtual machines, which is required for running application benchmarks. The copied client machine ssh public key as well as that of the server machine are copied to virtual machines at each level on the first virtual machine run automatically.

From the client,
```
# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AABB...
```
From the server,
```
# cd scripts
# echo 'ssh-rsa AABB...' > client_ssh_public
```

## Physical/virtual machine setup
Prepare two physical machines and connect them through a private network. We use the following IP addresses in the experiments. Scripts in this repo use those IP addresses. If you choose to use other IP addresses, please update scripts, too.
* A physical machine running virtual machines (i.e. server machine): 10.10.1.2
* A physical machine sending workloads to the virtual machines (i.e. client machine): 10.10.1.1

In addition, configure virtual machines at each level use the following IP addresses on the server machine. If you are a cloudlab user, download a preconfigured VM image [here](#cloudlab-profiles)
* L1: 10.10.1.100
* L2: 10.10.1.101
* L3: 10.10.1.102

Once the physical machines and virtual machines are ready, follow those steps to run experiments.
1. Prepare custom [Linux kernel](#kernel-setup) and [QEMU](#qemu-setup) based on [the preparation instruction](#software-preparation-overview).
2. [Run a virtual machine](#running-a-virtual-machine) on the server machine or [get the server ready](#running-a-physical-machine) for bare-metal measurements.
3. [Run application benchmarks and collect results](#running-application-benchmarks-and-collect-results) on the client machine.
4. [Terminate the virtual machine](#terminating-a-virtual-machine) on the server machine.
5. Repeat 1 to 4 for [all configurations](#server-machine).

## Software Preparation Overview
For the experiments, we need to install custom Linux kernel and QEMU. On the server, we need to install Linux kernel and QEMU on the server **and in each virtual machine** based on the experiment configuration. See [software configuration tables](#software-configurations) to get the correct version to install.

When setting software for a virtual machine, you first need to boot the virtual machine to configure and do the following steps as you do in the server. For example, when you configure a L1 VM for one of the [L2 experiments](#l2-experiments), [boot the L1 VM first](#running-a-virtual-machine), copy/configure kernel, build QEMU, and terminate the L1 VM to make the changes effective. Then you are ready to run the L2 experiments.

On the client, we just need to install Linux kernel once. The kernel branch name is `v4.18-base`.

The next sections explain how to compile and install Linux kernel and QEMU.

## Kernel Setup
Kernel setup involves compiling and installing kernel, updating kernel parameter, and **rebooting** the machine.

Download Linux source through git submodule command once. See [here](#cloudlab-profiles) to select a machine for kernel compile for Cloudlab users.

Run all commands in this Kernel Setup section under `./linux` directory after Linux source is downloaded.
```
# git submodule update --init linux
# cd linux
```

Pick a branch name from the [software configuration tables](#software-configurations), and run this command to switch to the branch.
```
# git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Kernel configuration
```
# make dvh_x86_defconfig
```

### Kernel compile
Run this script to compile and install kernel. Say Y for 'make modules_install' if this is the first time building a branch. Each branch needs their own modules. The compiled kernel will have a local version of this format by default: 4.18.0-`branch name after v4.18-`. For example if you compile a branch named `v4.18-base`, the the kernel version will be `4.18.0-base`.
```
# build-n-install.sh
LOCALVERSION?[base]:
make modules_instsall?[y/N]:
```

### Kernel install
Copy new kernel files to a running physical/virtual machine. Note that the machine you ran `build-n-install.sh` on already has kernel files in place.
```
# copy-kernel.sh
Target machine IP?
10.10.1.100
```

### Kernel parameter setup

Once you copy kernel, you need to update grub to boot from the copied kernel with proper kernel parameters. This will be done by updating `/etc/default/grub` file. See additionl instructions for Cloudlab users [here](#kernel-parameter-in-cloudlab).

Change `GRUB_DEFAULT` to point the copied kernel. This is an example of 4.18.0-base kernel.
```
K_VER=4.18.0-base
GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux $K_VER"
```

You also need to update the line starting `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` in `/etc/default/grub` file. By default, it would look like this
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0,115200n8"
```
Append proper options to the line from the [software configuration tables](#software-configurations). For example, L0 kernel parameter for L3 baseline measurements would look like this.
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0,115200n8 maxcpus=10 kvm-intel.nested=1"
```

Once you updated the `grub` file, do the followings to make the change effective.
```
# update-grub
# reboot
```

Ensure that the kernel version and core numbers are changed correctly with the following commands.
```
# uname -r
# lscpu
```

## QEMU Setup

Download QEMU source through git submodule command once.
```
# git submodule update --init qemu
```

Pick a branch name from the [software configuration tables](#software-configurations), and run these commands to switch to the branch and to compile. Note that the script that runs virtual machines, `run-vm.py`, will use the compiled QEMU binary automatically **assuming that you cloned this repository under the home directory of root account**.

```
# cd qemu
# git checkout <branch-name>
./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu && make clean && make -j
```


## Client Setup
The client machine should have this repository in the home directory.
```
# git clone https://github.com/columbia/dvh-asplos-ae.git
```

The client machine should have the baseline kernel, which is v4.18-base. Update as described in [Kernel Setup](#kernel-setup). 

## Running a physical machine
For the L0 measurement preparation, we don't [run any virtual machines](#running-a-virtual-machine). You only need to run this script **on the server** to limit the memory size as discussed in the paper. You are [ready to run the experiments](#running-application-benchmarks-and-collect-results).

```
# cd scripts
# ./consume_mem.sh 12
```

## Running a virtual machine

**On the server machine**, run the `run-vm.py` script to set up the VM image path, virtualization level and vitualization configuration such as baseline, passthrough, dvh-pv, or dvh. This script will run to the last level virtual machine automatically. When you see `Ready to run experiments!` message, you are [ready to run the experiments](#running-application-benchmarks-and-collect-results). See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for any problems.

```
# cd scripts
# ./run-vm.py
--------- VM configurations -------
1. [/vm/v4.18.img] VM Image path
2. [base] VM Configuration
3. [2] Virtualization Level
Enter number to update configuration. Enter 0 to start a VM:
...
<virtual machine boot log>
...
Ready to run experiments!
```

## Running application benchmarks and collect results
Run this command **on the client machine**. It will automatically install and run all the applications for the performance evaluation on the server and the client machines. The result will be saved in the client machine under the directory you entered by "Enter test name:" prompt.
```
# cd dvh-asplos-ae
# cd scripts
# ./run-benchmarks.sh [L0|L1|L2|L3]
[0] ==== Start Test =====
[1] All
[2] Hackbench
[3] mysql
[4] netperf-rr
[5] netperf-stream
[6] netperf-maerts
[7] apache
[8] memcached
Type test number(Enter 0 to start tests): 1
Enter test name: L2-dvh
How many times to repeat? 3
```

Once the experiments are done, run this command to collect results. It will show the results in csv format. Each column is one run (typically consists of 50 iterations). For example, the following results show there are two runs of netperf rr and netperf stream where each run consists of four iterations for a demo purpose.
```
# ./results.py [test name]
netperf-rr
----------netperf-rr----
20081.91,19990.36
20089.42,20135.43
19987.31,19985.2
20029.22,20158.78
------------------------

netperf-stream
----------netperf-stream--
9413.8,9413.92
9411.59,9413.5
9414.17,9414.33
9414.13,9414.27
------------------------
```

Once the data is collected, get the average of each run and pick the best average number of all runs for each application benchmark. That's how we get application performance. [This template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LwybiiGdiOgiuagrn9A3zcAKfsIzDAv9VSb0myU-3d8/edit?usp=sharing) would help to collect data.

[Here are the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kJHflbqUu7mUiWMyHituv0whZJQagVIOqvtiBbd93kM/edit?usp=sharing) we have used for the paper.

## Terminating a virtual machine
After the experiment, you need to terminate a (nested) virtual machine. Run `halt -p` command iteratively inside virtual machines  running **on the server** until you get the server shell. Run `exit` command once to finally exit the `run-vm.py` script.
```
[Lx ~] # halt -p

Broadcast message from root@guest0
...

[kvm-node ~] # exit
[kvm-node ~] #
```

## Instructions for Cloudlab

### Joining Cloudlab
Please sign up in cloud.us: https://www.cloudlab.us/signup.php to be able to access machines. Join the existing project: KVMARM, and I will receive a notification automatically and I will let you in.

### Cloudlab profiles
* Use the `x86-u16-two` profile for running experiments. To get enough storage for the VM image, do the following in the server node. **Note that you need more than 45G storage**, and the sda4 partition will suffice.
```
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4
# mkdir /vm
# mount /dev/sda4 /vm
```

* Copy the VM image to the directory
```
# cd /vm
# cp /proj/kvmarm-PG0/jintack/nested/ae-guest0.img.bz2 .
# pbzip2 -dk ae-guest0.img.bz2
```

* Use the `tdataset` profile for compiling code, especially Linux kernel. Copy the ssh public key of the node to a node that you are copying kernel to. To get enough storage for compiling kernel, do the following. 
```
# cd /tmp/env/scripts 
# ./mkfs-wisc-sdc.sh
# cd /sdc
```
### Kernel parameter in Cloudlab
`/etc/default/grub` file in Cloudlab machine has duplicated entries such as GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX. **Please delete the last three lines of the file.** You just need to do it only once per physical machine. It looks like the followings.

```
# The remaining lines were added by Emulab slicefix
# DO NOT ADD ANYTHING AFTER THIS POINT AS IT WILL GET REMOVED.
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0,115200"
GRUB_TERMINAL=serial
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --unit=0 --port=0x3F8 --speed=115200"
```

## Troubleshooting

* If `run-vm.py` script went wrong and if you can't type any command, enter ctrl+C. When the script went wrong, you are still in the execution of the script. Ctrl+C will take you back to the shell.
